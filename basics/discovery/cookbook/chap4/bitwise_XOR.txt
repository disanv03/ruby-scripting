in ruby what is bitwise XOR
Bitwise XOR (^) in Ruby is a binary operation that compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. If one bit is 0 and the other bit is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0. 

For example, if we have two integers 10 (which is 1010 in binary) and 4 (which is 0100 in binary), the bitwise XOR operation would result in 14 (which is 1110 in binary). 

In Ruby, you can perform a bitwise XOR operation with the ^ operator. Here's how:

```
a = 10
b = 4
c = a ^ b
puts c
# Output: 14
```

In this example, the binary representation of 10 is 1010 and of 4 is 0100. If we perform a bitwise XOR operation, we get 1110, which is 14 in decimal.
and if we do bitwise XOR of b ^ c
If we perform a bitwise XOR operation of `b ^ c` using the values of `b` and `c` from the previous example (where `b` is 4 and `c` is 14), we get:

```
b = 4
c = 14
d = b ^ c
puts d
# Output: 10
```

In this example, the binary representation of 4 is 0100 and of 14 is 1110. If we perform a bitwise XOR operation, we get 1010, which is 10 in decimal. This is because XOR operation gives a result of 1 only if the two compared bits have different values, and in this case, when we perform 4 XOR 14, it results in 10.
ok bitwise XOR, for same bit keep it if 0 and 0 become 0 and if 1 and 1 become 1. But if is different that become 1
Actually, your last statement is not correct for the XOR operation. In the XOR operation, if both bits are the same (0 and 0, or 1 and 1), the result is 0. If the bits are different (0 and 1, or 1 and 0), the result is 1. 

So, to correct your statement: 

Bitwise XOR, for the same bit values gives a result of 0 (0 XOR 0 results in 0, 1 XOR 1 results in 0). But if the bits are different, the result is 1 (0 XOR 1 results in 1, 1 XOR 0 results in 1). This is why XOR is sometimes thought of as the "inequality" operator.
just XOR stand for ?
XOR stands for "Exclusive OR". It's a logical operation that outputs true or 1 only when the number of true or 1 inputs is odd. In the context of binary operations, as we discussed, it gives a result of 1 only if the two compared bits have different values.
