Explain UTC time
UTC stands for Coordinated Universal Time. It is a time standard used in various fields worldwide, including aviation, telecommunications, and computer systems. UTC is based on atomic time, which is highly precise and stable.

UTC does not observe daylight saving time, so it remains constant throughout the year. It is used as a reference time for coordinating activities and synchronizing clocks across different time zones.

UTC is often used as a basis for converting local times to a common standard. To convert local time to UTC, one needs to consider the time difference between the local time zone and UTC. For example, if the local time is 3 PM and the time difference is +2 hours, then the corresponding UTC time would be 1 PM.

UTC is represented in a 24-hour format, where the time is expressed as hours, minutes, and seconds. It is also often accompanied by a "+/-" sign and a numerical value denoting the time difference from UTC, such as UTC+3 or UTC-5.

Overall, UTC serves as a global time standard that allows for consistent timekeeping and coordination across various regions and industries.
