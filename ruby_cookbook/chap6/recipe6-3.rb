# Changing the permissions on a File
# Problem:
# You want to control access to a file by modifying its Unix premissions.
# For instance, you want to make it so that everyone on your system can read a file,
# but only you can write to it.

# lstat retrivees the file status of symbolic links rather than the file they point to.
# Given information like when is was created, its size...
